# The Power Plant
Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement (Olin College Fall 2017) final project arduino code and documentation. 

# Summary
[title](http://isim.olin.edu/index.shtml)
[Intro to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement]() is an introductory analog circuits class at Olin College of Engineering. Throughout the class, we use inquiry-based labs to explore concepts such as RC filters, operational amplifiers, and impedance. For the final project, we had to pick a problem we could solve through analog circuits: for that reason, we chose to make a plant wellness system complete with components such as a custom sensor and relaxation oscillator. To automate the process, we used a very simple arduino program.
